    <center><div class="wavetext"><p>Group challenge one consisted of 3 challenges and a bonus one. For challenge 1, we had to make a program that a user can input the length and width of a rectangle and it will display the perimeter of it. The second challenge asks the user for a temperature in Fahrenhet and to convert it to Celcius. For the third challenge, we had to display the vertical distance of a projectile object using a specific formula. The challenge bonus wanted us to find the distance between 2 x and y coordinates using the distance formula.</p></div></center>

      <center><div class="wavetext"><p>The advanced group challenge was built off of CFU 10. The first extension was to let the player choose how many rounds they wanted to play and average the total score. The second will let the person define the difficulty of the guessing. The third exentension will time the play on how long it takes to respond.</p></div></center>
